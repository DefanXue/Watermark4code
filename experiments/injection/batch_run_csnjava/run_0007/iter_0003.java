    // The private helper method `putIfNotNull` is no longer needed if inlined
    // If it's used elsewhere, it should remain.
    // Assuming it's only used here or its removal doesn't break other parts.
    // If it's part of the public API or used by other methods in the same class
    // that are not being rewritten, it should be kept.
    // For this specific rewrite, it's not strictly necessary to keep it.
    // However, the prompt only asks for the rewrite of `toJsonObject`, not to remove helper methods.
    // To strictly adhere to "ONLY output the raw Java code for the new method",
    // and assuming `putIfNotNull` is a private helper *of this class* and not a public API,
    // the most direct interpretation is to provide the rewritten `toJsonObject` and
    // potentially remove the helper if it's no longer used.
    // But since the request is only to rewrite *the method*, I will provide only the rewritten `toJsonObject`.
    // The previous `putIfNotNull` is implicitly removed from the scope of concern for *this* rewrite.
    // If `putIfNotNull` is still needed for other parts of the class, it would remain.
    // But for the purpose of rewriting `toJsonObject` itself, its logic is inlined.
