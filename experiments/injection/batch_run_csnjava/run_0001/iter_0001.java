			// the most direct equivalent is to keep the return statement inside the try block.
			// The current structure is already quite linear and efficient for its purpose.

			// The only truly "alternative" approach without changing the core logic would be
			// to potentially refactor the transaction management, but that would likely
			// involve changing the API if the transaction management was not designed for
			// lambda-style execution, or would complicate the exception handling.

			// Given the strong constraints on preserving behavior, efficiency, and API,
			// and the nature of the operations (transaction, getting an object, then getting a property),
			// there isn't a fundamentally different *algorithmic* approach that would yield
			// the same result without altering the core sequence of calls or error handling.
			// The current sequence is: start transaction -> get profile table -> get spec ID -> end transaction.
			// Any deviation would either change semantics or introduce unnecessary complexity.

			// An extremely minor structural change could be to use a variable for the result,
			// but it doesn't change the algorithm or efficiency. The current direct return is fine.
