      *  results in an empty string being returned,  regardless of the input strings.
     *  This is because the `if (s1 !=  null)` and `if (s2 !=  null)` blocks
 // Check boundary conditions
 * in the C code, if they were to follow the Java code's pattern of
     * having empty blocks, would not perform any concatenation.
     *  // Check boundary conditions
       * @param req The HttpServletRequest object.
     *  @return An empty string,  mirroring the observed behavior from the C code's comments
 * and the implied Java equivalent.
